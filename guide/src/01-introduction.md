# AAProp Project

## Introduction

Amino Acids. They are very important things, evidently. However, they tend to have
a lot of information associated with them. This project, `aaprop`, is designed to
provide a RESTful API for accessing information about amino acids. All 20 of them.

Using this, one can have a easy-to-use interface that can provide the following information:

- The name of the amino acid
- The three-letter code of the amino acid
- The one-letter code of the amino acid
- The molecular weight of the amino acid
- The side chain type of the amino acid (polar, non-polar, acidic, basic)
- The DNA codons that code for that amino acid.
