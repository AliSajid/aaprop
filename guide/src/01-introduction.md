# **Amino Acid Properties API (`aaprop`)**  

Amino acids are fundamental building blocks of life, serving as the essential components of proteins and playing critical roles in various biochemical processes. Each of the twenty standard amino acids possesses distinct physicochemical properties, structural features, and codons, all of which are crucial for understanding protein function, enzyme activity, and molecular biology at large.  

To facilitate easy access to standardized amino acid information, this project, **`aaprop`**, provides a **RESTful API** designed to serve as a structured repository of key amino acid properties. The API offers an intuitive and programmatically accessible interface for retrieving essential data on all twenty standard amino acids.  

Through this API, users can obtain the following fundamental details about any amino acid:  

- **Full Name**–The complete scientific name of the amino acid.  
- **Three-Letter Code**–conventional three-letter abbreviation used in biochemistry (for example, Ala for Alanine).  
- **One-Letter Code**–e single-character representation commonly used in protein sequences (for example, A for Alanine).  
- **Molecular Weight**–The precise molecular mass of the amino acid, expressed in Daltons (Da).  
- **Side Chain Classification**–The categorization of the amino acid's side chain based on its chemical properties, distinguishing between **polar, non-polar, acidic, and basic** residues.  
- **DNA Codons**–The set of nucleotide triplets that encode the amino acid according to the standard genetic code.  

By utilizing `aaprop`, researchers, developers, and bioinformatics professionals can integrate amino acid data into computational models, biochemical studies, and educational tools with ease and efficiency.
